# Intermittent Hover Effect Failure in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where hover effects intermittently fail to apply correctly.  The issue appears to be tied to specific CSS updates or changes, and doesn't manifest consistently across all elements.

The `bug.js` file shows example code where the hover effect is not functioning as expected.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential solution or workaround.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

* **CSS Specificity Conflicts:**  High-priority CSS rules might override the Tailwind hover styles.
* **Incorrect Class Ordering:** Ensure proper order of Tailwind classes.  Incorrect ordering can lead to style clashes.
* **JavaScript Interference:**  JavaScript manipulations affecting element styles might interfere with Tailwind's hover behavior.
* **Caching Issues:** Clear browser cache and ensure Tailwind CSS is correctly compiled and updated.
* **Plugin Conflicts:** If using Tailwind CSS plugins, a conflict with one might be causing issues.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the code in `bug.js` (after setting up a suitable environment).
3. Observe the unexpected hover behavior.
4. Compare with the solution in `bugSolution.js`.
